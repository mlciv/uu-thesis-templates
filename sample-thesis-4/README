This sample thesis extends that in ../sample-thesis-3/ to incorporate
hyperref, natbib compatiable support, which includes autoref, the clickable table of content,
bookmark, and so on.

However, this template removes the references after per chapter, which is more commonly used in thesis.

For including the whole pdf and adding reference after each chapter, we move it into ../sample-thesis-4/

The easiest way to compile this sample thesis on any Unix platform is
to simply type

	make

That runs the rough equivalent of these commands:

	pdflatex sample-thesis-4.ltx
	bibtex sample-thesis-4
	fgrep -v fsfname sample-thesis-4.idx | makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-4.ist > sample-thesis-4.ind
	fgrep bioname sample-thesis-4.idx | fgrep -v '|see' | makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-4.ist > sample-thesis-4-bioname.ind
	fgrep fsfname sample-thesis-4.idx | fgrep -v '|see' | makeindex -c -s sample-thesis-4.ist > sample-thesis-4-fsfname.ind

Repeat them FOUR (4) times to achieve consistency.

If there are no indexes, then repeat just the first two commands four
times.

During the writing process, the fastest update is done by

	make pdf-pass

It runs pdflatex, bibtex, and makeindex just once.  If the
bibliography and index are already stable, then only pdflatex needs to
be run:

	pdflatex sample-thesis-4.ltx
